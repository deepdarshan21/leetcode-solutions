/*
   Approach: Brute Force
        First store all the possible permutation in circular array from the set of elements present in given vector(permutation),
        then find the position of given vector(permutation), therfore next permutation after that permutation
        is next element from the store.

   Edge Cases:

   Time Complexity: O(n!) Space: O(n!)
   Status: Time Limit Exceeded
   Runtime:  ms faster than: %
   Memory Usage:  MB less than: %
   Remarks: Because of constraints, this approach will result in TLE
